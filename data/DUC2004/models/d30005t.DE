A spokesman 
for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups. I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with 
him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with 
him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.'' But intelligence 
agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa 
plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the 
chemical weapons program. In addition, a soil sample that the CIA 
clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical 
used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack over his 
decision to strike the Shifa plant. Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996. At the time of the Aug. 20 cruise 
missile attack, Clinton administration officials acknowledge, they 
did not know that Idris owned the Shifa factory. A Sudanese 
expatriate who now lives in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, was previously 
a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. But Pendry 
denied that Idris owned any businesses with the Military Industrial 
Corp. U.S. intelligence officials declined to provide details about 
the reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad. According to 
the officials, White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the 
months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal 
under U.S. and international law. A 1976 executive order 
bars anyone working for the U.S. government from plotting or carrying 
out assassinations. But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official said this week that 
the infrastructure of bin Laden's group is mostly ``human.'' Targeting infrastructure, 
officials acknowledged, can also mean destroying the leadership of 
a terrorist group. ``Command and control of an enemy is a justifiable 
target,'' Leavy said. Officials said that at roughly the same 
time, the White House drafted the legal justification for military 
attacks against a terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered. The order said: ``No person employed by, or acting on behalf 
of the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage 
in, assassination.'' While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified 
ban, it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over 
the years. The Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday 
of looking for an ``excuse'' to launch another missile attack on his 
war-shattered homeland. On Aug. 20 the United States 
retaliated by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps 
in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. ``America is looking for an excuse to fire 
more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' 
Saqib said. Washington, which has posted a dlrs 5 million reward for 
bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan. ``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban 
hosts. So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin 
Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban. ``Bin Laden is not 
a sinful man ... America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' 
he said. ``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.'' The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia. The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday. The magazine said much of it was based on the testimony of 
an FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who made only vague 
connections between Salim and terrorist activities. Zierl declined 
to comment on the report, but said U.S. authorities probably asked 
for more time just a precautionary measure. U.S. authorities charge 
Salim helped finance, train and arm members of a terrorist organization, 
including the alleged bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A criminal complaint unsealed Sept. 25 in U.S. District Court in New 
York charges him with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass 
destruction. NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives 
of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously 
injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern 
District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday. The blast at 
the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of 
them Americans, and injured 5,400. The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed 
Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the 
Southern District of New York. Fazul 
Abdullah Mohammed is a fugitive. Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan. Those arrested need not be taken to court 
for trial for up to three months. Under Taliban rules women may not study or 
work outside their houses, and all kinds of light entertainment including 
music are banned. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government hasn't recognized 
the Taliban government in Afghanistan. ``Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Algerians, 
Tunisians, Sudanese and Kuwaitis _ they come from several different 
organizations,'' Klosi was quoted as telling The Sunday Times. Interpol believes more than 100,000 blank Albanian passports were 
stolen in riots last year, providing ample opportunity for terrorists 
to acquire false papers, the newspaper said. Apparent confirmation 
of the Bin Laden's activities came earlier this month during the murder 
trial of Claude Kader, 27, a French national and self-confessed member 
of Bin Laden's Albanian network, the newspaper said. Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness: One of his senior 
aides who has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years. The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan. According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain. It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere, 
or hiding under government protection. The report was typed on a computer seized last year 
by Kenyan authorities, according to a government filing last week 
in U.S. district court in Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have 
charged at least six members of bin Laden's organization with terrorist 
activities or conspiracy. In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates. The arrangement appears to have resulted 
from a plea bargain in which the source is cooperating in hopes of 
receiving a lesser sentence. In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. The government has also said in other court papers that the source 
helped identify bin Laden's signature on a 1996 document urging Muslims 
to kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not 
be reached for comment. He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans. The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden. Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.'' He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions. The papers said the computer 
was seized in August 1997 in a raid by Kenyan authorities that was 
attended by an FBI agent. The author talks of how he and his fellow 
operatives follow events on CNN and use the Internet to communicate. He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East 
Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on 
big decisions. He has denied any connection 
to terrorist activities. The documents, which were initially filed in secret, 
include a federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz of conspiring with 
bin Laden to kill Americans overseas. A second count charges him with 
soliciting others to do so. The report made clear that the organization 
was being run on a shoestring. ``What do you think? He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. ``There is a war and the situation is dangerous,'' he said. He wrote 
that American forces kidnapped anyone who threatened the national 
security or American citizens. The author noted with alarm a recent 
CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees 
had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial. He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi.
